Recursion

    In your own words, what is recursion?

        Recursion is when a function calls itself in order to complete an operation. 

    Why is it necessary to have a base case?

        If you do not have a base case the function will continue to call itself and will not return a value.

    How is a graph different from a tree?

        A graph unlike trees is cyclical and is non-directional. 

    Give an example of something that would be good to model with a graph.
